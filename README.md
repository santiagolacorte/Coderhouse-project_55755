# Project_55755
This is a personal project developed for commission No. 55755 of Coderhouse, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also supported on high-speed frameworks such as Flask and Bootstrap.

The code represents an interactive "FizzBuzz" style game with users, where +1 point is added for each chosen number that is a multiple of 3 or 5, +3 points if it is a multiple of 3 and 5, and -1 point if it does not meet any of these conditions.

## Pre-delivery 1
A simple interaction was developed using prompts and alerts to simulate a FizzBuzz game.

### Steps to follow:
Improve the code level by transitioning from variable handling to objects and arrays.

## Pre-delivery 2
Objects and arrays were added to the script logic.

### Steps to follow:
Enhance user interaction through DOM manipulation.

## Pre-delivery 3
The DOM is manipulated through events, handling numbers as dynamically created elements through JavaScript. Data handling with localStorage and JSON is also added to preserve information that facilitates user interaction with the application.

To run the app, execute `pipenv install`, `pipenv shell` and then run `flask run`

### Steps to follow:
- Apply SOLID principles to the code to improve its scalability and understanding.
- Enhance the application's appearance through CSS and HTML.

## Final Delivery:
TBD
